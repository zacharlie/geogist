# GeoGist üåç

Geospatial script template generator and content discovery framework.

The best** way to share and discover Geospatial scripts, gists or code snippets.

GeoGist was created using the initial work from the [PyQgist](https://github.com/zacharlie/pyqgist) project as a scaffold but extending the system design and available tags to serve more generic purposes, including multiple platforms, languages and script functions.
